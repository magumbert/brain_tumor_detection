# Brain Tumor Detection

![MRI Brain Tumor](MRI_brain_tumor.jpg)

This project leverages computer vision to detect and classify brain tumors from MRI scans.

Requires GPU. Everything can be found within the `brain_tumor_detection.ipynb` notebook.

Workflow is as follows:

1. Data Augmentation
2. Train-Test split
3. Build naive baseline CNN
4. Transfer-learning using ResNet50
5. Transfer-learning using EfficientNet

Development currently still in progress.

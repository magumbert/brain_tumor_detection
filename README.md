This project leverages computer vision to detect and classify brain tumors from MRI scans.

Requires GPU. Everything can be found within the brain_tumor_detection.ipynb notebook.

Workflow is as follows:
1. Data Augmentation
2. Train-Test split
3. Build naive baseline CNN.
4. Transfer-learning using RestNet50.
5. Transfer-learning using EfficientNet.


Development currently still in progress.

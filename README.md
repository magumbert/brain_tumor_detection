<img src="MRI_brain_tumor.jpg" alt="MRI Brain Tumor" width="300">

This project leverages computer vision techniques to detect and classify brain tumors from MRI scans. The workflow includes data augmentation, model training, and applying transfer learning using pre-trained models.

## Requirements

- GPU
- Jupyter Notebook

## Notebook

All steps and code are available in the `brain_tumor_detection.ipynb` notebook.

## Workflow

1. **Data Augmentation**: Enhance the dataset with various transformations to improve model robustness.
2. **Train-Test Split**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. **Build Naive Baseline CNN**: Develop and train a basic Convolutional Neural Network as a baseline model.
4. **Transfer-learning using ResNet50**: Apply transfer learning using the ResNet50 architecture to improve performance.
5. **Transfer-learning using EfficientNet**: Further enhance the model using EfficientNet for better accuracy.

## Development Status

Development is currently in progress!
